Creativity Renaissance in Education and Organizations

Unite Global Innovators to Co-Create & Explore the Boundary of Creativity

About CREO
Came out of the origin of "Creativity" in Latino language, CREO, Creativity Renaissance in Education & Organizations is founded in 2020 by a group of people around the world from high-tech industries, academia and schools. We're focusing on bridging creativity, humanity, technology and education.
The AI Creativity Project is our first initiative. In this project, we aim to integrate global resources to build the systems of methods, tools and courses to help humans co-live and co-create with AI by playing to each other's strengths to achieve more. Welcome to join CREO, initiating or participating in creativity-exploration projects to make a better world.

CREO社区由一群来自全球的科技界、学术界、教育界的人士创立于2020年，致力于探索创造力、人文、技术以及教育的融合。CREO的名字来源于拉丁文“创造”。
“AI创造力”是我们的首个探索项目，旨在整合全球资源，构建方法、工具和课程的体系，帮助人类与AI各展所长、共生共创。欢迎加入CREO社区，发起或参与各种方向的创造力探索项目，让世界变得更美好。
